We specialize in providing short term debt financing solutions (aka, Bridge Loans) to emerging growth companies.  These companies typically have a minimum of $2MM in trailing 12-month revenues and are growing at a rate exceeding 50%/year. Our loans help these borrowers get to Series Seed/A/B/C of equity, get to cash flow positive operations or even to an M&A exit.  Our loan sizes are from $250,000 to $2MM and the terms are from 12 – 18 months, thus we like companies with low burn rates (e.g., <$200k/mo).   We focus primarily on western US companies, with a geographic reach from San Diego to Seattle and although we are generalists, we steer clear of FinTech, BioTech, Energy & Entertainment business models.

",Flexible,"SPECIAL Amazon Inventory:
Amazon FBA Liquid Inventory product:
Currently only FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) is within scope. This product on its own will only provide advances against AR and inventory held by Amazon.
In the longer term, we will be expanding to include other e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Walmart, etc. However, this is still several months away at a minimum.
The LOC operates like a traditional ABL line of credit. However, no inventory appraisal or field exam is needed. Instead, we use the Amazon data, provided by linking through Symphonie, to value the inventory and calculate the borrowing base.
Because of our direct connection with Amazon data, we can lend against inventory held in Amazon warehouses. Most lenders cannot do this, and this is the main advantage of this product type.
The other nice thing about LI is that we can add it as a supplemental LOC for companies that already have existing lending relationships with banks or other lenders. We will simply need to get a lien carveout for the Amazon AR and inventory, and we will be able to provide extra availability that their existing lenders can’t from their Amazon inventory.
In addition to all of that, it is a relatively quick and low touch underwriting process relative to more traditional products.
High level terms are as follows:
Term: 1-3 years
Rate: Floating based on Prime, low to mid-teens rate all in
Advance rates: 80% of NOLV of inventory, 85% of AR, both of which are exclusive to Amazon.","Canada,US,UK,Colorado and West,North America",,,,,Matthew Tobin,"Senior Vice President, Business Development",(805) 815-6858,(805) 815-6858,Paz Piña,,,,,Yes,12/22/2025 12:43pm,,,,,,,
