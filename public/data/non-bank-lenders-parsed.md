With a combined experience of over two decades in state-of-the-art impact investing initiatives, the principals of the firm have successfully placed over $2 billion in more than 250 social enterprises across 50 countries. It is an innovative and forward-thinking firm that operates across three functional areas: Asset Management, Advisory and Philanthropic Services, and the Establishment of Social Businesses. The company promotes impact investments in for-profit businesses that align with financial, social, and environmental goals. It collaborates with individual, institutional, philanthropic, and public sector investors to create market-based investment opportunities with mitigated risk. The firm's primary focus is to generate positive economic, social, and environmental impact through well-designed investment funds. Their efforts aim to raise the standard of living for people and communities at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP), with a particular emphasis on solar energy, financial inclusion, and affordable housing sectors in some of the world's poorest countries. For impact investors, SIMA provides opportunities to invest in leading companies that generate attractive financial returns while also creating measurable social impact. The company also offers impact assessments and portfolio reviews to investors, helping them evaluate and optimize their impact investing strategies. Additionally, the firm also provides comprehensive advisory services to practitioners in areas such as valuations, risk management, internal control, investment readiness, ESG compliance, gender action, and impact reporting. It has further demonstrated its commitment to advancing impact investing through the establishment of the SIMA Impact Foundation. This foundation focuses on making early-stage investments to demonstrate the potential of emerging impact sectors that may not yet be commercially financed. By doing so, the firm aims to spur the growth of these sectors and promote further impact investing opportunities. To broaden its impact, it has also launched Sow Good Investments, a platform that provides investment opportunities to both accredited and non-accredited investors. This initiative enables individuals to contribute to creating a better world while potentially building wealth for themselves. It is a dynamic organization comprising 40 dedicated individuals, with a majority of 38 professionals operating in emerging markets across Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Zimbabwe, India, and Pakistan.
